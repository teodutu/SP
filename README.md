## Labs
### Lab 1 - OpenSSL
Downloading, creating and self-signing certificates from the command line.
For creating and signing the certificate, _inspiration was drawn_ from [this](https://github.com/security-summer-school/web/tree/session-03-secure-comm/03-securing-communication) SSS-Web lab.
The code that programatically generates an unsigned certificate is mostly copy-pasted from [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/codepool/how-to-use-openssl-to-generate-x-509-certificate-request.html).
